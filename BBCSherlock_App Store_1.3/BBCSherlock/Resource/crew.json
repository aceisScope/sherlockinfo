After graduating with an MA in English from Glasgow University, he worked as a teacher for three years before being commissioned to write the pilot script for a children’s television series about the creation of a school newspaper. </p><p>Steven met his second wife, Sue Virtue, at the Edinburgh Television Festival in 1996. Soon after, Moffat wrote ‘Chalk’, a sitcom based more explicitly upon his three years spent as a teacher. </p><p>n 2004 Steven Moffat achieved a childhood dream – being asked to write for the revived series of Doctor Who. He had previously written prose novels and a spoof homage for a Children in Need broadcast, but this was the real thing. His contribution to the first series of the revival starring Christopher Eccleston, was the two part story ‘The Empty Child’ and ‘The Doctor Dances’, notable for introducing the character of Captain Jack Harkness, played by John Barrowman, who would go on to become the lead in the spin off series ‘Torchwood’. </p><p>Remaining at Hartswood, he co-created ‘Sherlock’ with Mark Gatiss during the transition to Doctor Who in 2008, writing a pilot script that was shot in January 2009. While not used in its first form, the BBC commissioned Hartswood to a series of three feature length episodes, a format that proved successful following the BBC’s production of ‘Wallander,’ starring Kenneth Branagh. Expanding on the pilot script, Steven Moffat contributed ‘A Study in Pink’, the first episode of Sherlock’s first series, based upon ‘A Study in Scarlet’, the story that detailed the first meeting between Sherlock Holmes and John Watson. Sherlock met with huge success on its broadcast in 2010, with the BBC recommissioning it for a second series. Moffat again wrote the first episode of the second series of the show, ‘A Scandal in Belgravia’, based in part upon the short Holmes story ‘A Scandal in Bohemia’.</p>"},{"title":"Sue Vertue","image":"Sue Vertue.jpeg","occupation":"Producer","brief":"<p>Sue Vertue entered the production world as a production manager for commercials.
