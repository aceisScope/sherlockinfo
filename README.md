sherlockinfo
============

codes for Sherlock Info version 1.3 in App Store. it's not worth any star, btw. these codes were written in 2011, when i was a newbie in iOS, so i assume those codes are crap.
gonna delete this app for "imagery infringement" ordered by the film company. fancy what they've been doing for the past 2 years.
not gonna make changes to help it survive in app store. too exhausted for that. i'm tired out from endless visits to doctors and now this minor bloody "issue" are trying to be the last feather.
